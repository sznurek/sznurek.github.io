Really, I just want to setup Jekyll on my Github Pages. But I think this
is good place to write some about myself.

My main passion is computer science. Currently I am learning programming
with dependent types (Coq, Agda) and planning to dig through Homotopy
Type Theory (looks nice!). For fun I am writing mostly in Haskell and
Javascript, for projects and work I use C, C++, Python, PHP and many
other - whatever gets work done.

I like to do some physics, music and writing but I am just an amateur.
